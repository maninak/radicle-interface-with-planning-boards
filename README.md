# Radicle Explorer

This user interface lets you interact with [Radicle][rad], a peer-to-peer code
collaboration and publishing stack, directly from your web browser.

**Deployment Options:**

* **Public Server:** The Radicle team maintains a public instance at [app.radicle.xyz][app]
* **Local-first:** Run the UI locally
* **Self-hosting:** Deploy the UI on your own server


## Local-first

**Prerequisites:**

* Recent versions of [Node.js][nod] (20.9.0 or higher) and [npm][npm] installed

Run the following commands to access the web UI locally:
```
git clone https://seed.radicle.xyz/z4V1sjrXqjvFdnCUbxPFqd5p4DtH5.git radicle-explorer
cd radicle-explorer
npm install
npm start
```
Then open http://localhost:3000 in your favourite browser.


## Self-Hosting the UI

There are several ways to deploy the UI publicly. Here are two common options:

**Using your own web server:**

1. Run `npm install && npm build` to create a build for deployment
2. Configure your web server to serve the contents of the `/build` directory

**Using Vercel (or similar static file hosting):**

1. Fork this repository to create your own version
2. Configure your Vercel account to deploy the forked repository

## Configuration

There's two ways to configure the UI:

**Create a `local.json` config file**

1. Copy [default.json][def] to a new file in the same folder called
   `local.json`.
2. Modify the properties in `local.json` to your preference.

**Environment variables**

1. Check [custom-environment-variables.json][env] for all available environment
   variables.
2. Set the desired environment variables when building the UI.

> For advanced configuration options, have a look at the [`node-config`][nco]
> package.
